It&acute;s sure to be a instant kid favorite.\r\n		Storytelling Benches\r\n		\r\n		Then catch up on your history at one of the storytelling benches located throughout the park, where you can hear tales of Franklin Square&acute;s past, or learn about the many communities touched by the Square, courtesy of the friendly storytellers of Once Upon a Nation.\r\n		<h3>Fountain</h3>\r\n		\r\n		And emanating from the corners of the historic park, four new herringbone brick walking paths with nighttime lighting bring even more charm to the Square after dark. The paths lead to the centerpiece of the Square, the Franklin Square Fountain, a marble masterpiece built in 1838 surrounded by wrought iron fences, which is currently still going under cosmetic restoration.\r\n		<h3>The History </h3>\r\n		\r\n		Originally named “North East Publick Square,” the 7.5-acre green is one of five original squares that William Penn laid out in his original plan of the city in 1682. The Square was renamed in honor of Benjamin Franklin in 1825.\r\n		\r\n		Over the years, the area has been used as a cattle pasture, a horse and cattle market, a burial ground, a drill and parade ground for the American military during the War of 1812 and, finally, a city park.\r\n		\r\n		In 1837, the city made Franklin Square into a public park and an elegant fountain was constructed in its center, a fountain thought to be the oldest surviving fountain in William Penn&acute;s five historic squares. The others are Rittenhouse, Washington, Logan and Center Square, where City Hall is now located.\r\n		<h3>SquareBurger </h3>\r\n		\r\n		Just in time for summer, Franklin Square has opened SquareBurger, a Stephen Starr-run “burger shack” selling summer staples: hot dogs, fries, milkshakes (made with Tasty Kakes) and, of course, hamburgers and cheeseburgers.\r\n		\r\n		SquareBurger is open until October - perfect for a couple bites between rounds of miniature golf!','Franklin Square','','publish','open','closed','','franklin-square','','','2016-06-08 22:40:04','2016-06-08 22:40:04','','0','http://dev.vinehurst.com/places/united-states/minnesota/sebeka/franklin-square/','0','gd_place','','0'), ('20','1','2016-06-08 22:40:05','2016-06-08 22:40:05','<h3>New Location! </h3>\r\n		\r\n		Who doesn&acute;t love the Please Touch Museum? And now, taking kids to the Museum is better than ever. The nation&acute;s premier children&acute;s museum - which has been a beloved landmark since it opened in 1976 - has a new home in Fairmount Park, opening its doors to a world of educational, hands-on fun.\r\n		\r\n		The new location in Memorial Hall - a National Historic Landmark built in 1876 for the Centennial Exhibition celebrating the country&acute;s 100th birthday - will boast three times more space for exhibitions and programs.\r\n		\r\n		Just outside the museum, kids and adults will also delight in riding the meticulously restored 1908 Woodside Park Dentzel Carousel, built in Philadelphia for a now-defunct amusement park 10 blocks from Memorial Hall.\r\n		\r\n		Visit The Please Touch Museum for more info!\r\n		<h3>The Experience </h3>\r\n		\r\n		The city&acute;s award-winning children&acute;s museum is fun-filled, totally hands-on, and so delightful that adults are entertained, too. Each nook and cranny has a different theme - from the fantastic to the practical. In Alice&acute;s Adventures in Wonderland, kids can play croquet with the Queen and sip tea with the Mad Hatter; nearby, oversized props bring Maurice Sendak&acute;s classics to life.\r\n		\r\n		Kids can take the wheel of a real bus and sail a boat on a mini-Delaware River; in “Nature&acute;s Pond,” the youngest visitors (age 3 and under) can discover animals nestled among high grass and a lily pond, or enjoy stories and nursery rhymes in “Fairytale Garden.” Please Touch is also a first live theater experience for young children - Please Touch Playhouse performances are original and interactive and take place daily!\r\n		\r\n		Please Touch Museum tends to be busier on rainy days. You may want to schedule your visit on fair weather days. Mornings are also a busy time with most school groups visiting during this time. Afternoons are a great time to visit the museum as well as Mondays when groups are not scheduled.\r\n		<h3>History </h3>\r\n		\r\n		One of the lasting museums from the tourist upgrade of Philadelphia that coincided with the 1976 Bicentennial celebration, Please Touch Museum® filled a gap in the city&acute;s cultural scene. Other museums in the area certainly have sections for children, but Please Touch Museum&acute;s new home not only offers three toddler areas, but also exciting exhibit components for older siblings (for ages 7 and up).\r\n		<h3>Visiting Tips </h3>\r\n		\r\n		Please Touch Museum tends to be busier on rainy days.

Stroll along the many paths through acres of exquisitely maintained grounds featuring 11,000 different types of plants.\r\n		\r\n		Encounter a new vista at each turn: the Italian Water Garden, Flower Garden Walk, aquatic display gardens and many others. Amble through Peirce&acute;s Woods, eight outdoor “rooms” of distinct woodland habitats.\r\n		\r\n		Inside the Conservatory is a lush world of exotic flowers, cacti, bromeliads, ferns and bonsai. Each season brings a different pleasure: spring magnolias and azaleas; summer roses and water lilies; fall foliage and chrysanthemums; and winter camellias, orchids and palms.\r\n		\r\n		On land Quaker settler George Peirce purchased from William Penn, Peirce&acute;s grandsons planted an impressive arboretum. The presence of a sawmill on the property prompted industrialist Pierre Samuel du Pont to buy the land in 1906 to save the trees.\r\n		\r\n		Christmas is spectacularly celebrated with carillon concerts, poinsettias and thousands of lights; summer evenings are embellished with concerts, illuminated fountain displays and occasional fireworks.\r\n		<h3>Come Prepared </h3>\r\n		\r\n		Longwood Gardens is open daily, year-round.\r\n		<h3>Don&acute;t Miss </h3>\r\n		\r\n		Indoor Children&acute;s Garden - Surrounded by tree-covered seating and Longwood&acute;s famous fountains, the new Indoor Children&acute;s Garden provides a safe and engaging space where children can learn about nature with amazing plants and fun activities around every corner.\r\n		\r\n		The Garden features a Central Cove, a Rain Pavilion and a Bamboo Maze, filled with a jungle of tree-sized bamboos for children to explore.\r\n		<h3>Outsider&acute;s Tip </h3>\r\n		\r\n		There are 17 fountains in the Indoor Children&acute;s Garden to enjoy, where children will want to splash and play.

And in the multi-sensory 4-D Migration Theater, viewers can follow Otis the Oriole on his first migration south from where he hatched in Fairmount Park.\r\n		\r\n		\r\n		<h3>The Experience at the Zoo</h3>\r\n		\r\n		One of the best laid-out and most animal-packed zoos in the country is set among a charming 42-acre Victorian garden with tree-lined walks, formal shrubbery, ornate iron cages and animal sculptures. The zoo has garnered many “firsts” in addition to being the first zoo charted in the United States (1859).\r\n		\r\n		The first orangutan and chimp births in a U.S. zoo (1928), world&acute;s first Children&acute;s Zoo (1957), and the first U.S. exhibit of white lions (1993), among others.\r\n		\r\n		In addition to its animals, the zoo is known for its historic architecture, which includes the country home of William Penn&acute;s grandson, its botanical collections of over 500 plant species, its groundbreaking research and its fine veterinary facilities.\r\n		Big Cat Falls\r\n		\r\n		The highly anticipated pride of the Philadelphia Zoo, Bank of America Big Cat Falls, home to felines from around the world, opened in 2006. The lush new exhibition features waterfalls, pools, authentic plantings and a simulated research station for aspiring zoologists.\r\n		\r\n		Lions, leopards, jaguars, pumas, tigers and seven new cubs are the star attractions.\r\n		<h3>Visitor Details </h3>\r\n		\r\n		Open daily, year-round. Parking can be tight so public transit is a great option.\r\n		\r\n		Check out the Zoo&acute;s trolley shuttle, available through October, making hourly stops at the Independence Visitor Center and 30th Street Station. Service is available starting at 10 a.m. seven days a week through August 31, 2008, with weekends-only service in September and October.\r\n		\r\n		SEPTA Routes 15 and 32 Buses stop within blocks of the zoo. Find specific stops and schedules here.\r\n		<h3>History</h3>\r\n		\r\n		The nation&acute;s oldest zoo was chartered in 1859, but the impending Civil War delayed its opening until 1874. In addition to its animals, the zoo is known for its historic architecture, which includes the country home of William Penn&acute;s grandson; its botanical collections of over 500 plant species; its groundbreaking research and its fine veterinary facilities.\r\n		\r\n		The Primate Reserve, Carnivore Kingdom, and Rare Animal Conservation Center, with its tree kangaroos and blue-eyed lemurs, are brand new, but there&acute;s still fun to be had in the historic, old-style bird, pachyderm and carnivore houses. In the Treehouse, kids can investigate the world from an animal&acute;s perspective; outdoors, the Zoo Balloon lifts passengers 400 feet into the air for a bird&acute;s-eye view of the zoo.','The Philadelphia Zoo','','publish','open','closed','','the-philadelphia-zoo','','','2016-06-08 22:40:10','2016-06-08 22:40:10','','0','http://dev.vinehurst.com/places/united-states/minnesota/sebeka/the-philadelphia-zoo/','0','gd_place','','0'), ('862','1','2016-06-15 02:38:14','2016-06-15 02:38:14','Born and raised in the heart of the west side, Jacob has quickly become a dominant force in the real estate world with his finger on the pulse.

An increasingly rare area of interior woodlands, defined as an area at least 300 feet from any road, lawn or meadow, provides a critical habitat for many species of birds, especially neo-tropical migrant songbirds.\r\n	\r\n	Situated on the western edge of Chester County, the land remains much as it did centuries ago, and now serves as a permanent refuge in an area facing dramatically increasing development pressure.\r\n	\r\n	The colorful birds that breed in the forest during the spring and summer months fly to South America for the winter. To survive here, they need abundant food and protection from the weather and predators, something they&acute;re able to find in Sadsbury Woods. A recent bird count identified more than 40 different species in just one morning.\r\n	\r\n	The preserve has been assembled from more than one dozen parcels, an effort that was made possible thanks to landowners who were willing to sell their land for conservation purposes. One such landowner recalled exploring these woods as a child and wanted to ensure that his grandchildren and great-grandchildren would be able to do the same. Natural Lands Trust is working to expand the preserve, and hopes to eventually protect a total of 600 acres.\r\n	Support the Natural Lands Trust\r\n	\r\n	The Natural Lands Trust seeks volunteers and members to help protect and care for Sadsbury Woods and its many other natural areas.

This innovative program invites passersby to stop, look, listen and see this city public art in a new way. Discover the untold histories of the 51 outdoor sculptures at 35 stops through these professionally produced three-minute interpretive audio segments. The many narratives have been spoken by more than 100 individuals, all with personal connections to the pieces of art.\r\n	\r\n	Works in Museum Without Walls: AUDIO include the sculpture Jesus Breaking Bread, which is located in front of the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul at 18th and Race Streets. The sculpture&acute;s audio program features the voices of three people who are each intimately, yet distinctly, connected to the piece. Listeners can hear Martha Erlebacher, the wife of the now-deceased sculptor and an artist herself, recall the personal challenge Walter Erlebacher set to humanize the figure. Monsignor John Miller, who oversaw the commission of the sculpture for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, discusses the artist confrontation with historic interpretation, and Sister Mary Scullion, who runs the renowned program for the homeless in Philadelphia, Project H.O.M.E., and who also attended the sculpture dedication as a student, talks about the importance of placing the figure outside of the church.\r\n	\r\n	In the audio program for the sculpture Iroquois, listeners will hear a first-person account from Mark di Suvero, the artist himself, who discusses the abstract sculpture and its open shapes that invite public interaction and viewing from multiple angles. I think that in order to experience [Iroquois] … you have to walk in through the piece, you have to have it all the way around you and at that moment, you can feel what that sculpture can do, says di Suvero. Lowell McKegney, di Suvero construction manager and longtime friend, compares the sculpture to music and encourages listeners to appreciate it in the same way.\r\n	<h3>History </h3>\r\n	\r\n	Philadelphia has more outdoor sculpture than any other American city, yet this extensive collection often goes unnoticed. This program is intended to reveal the distinct stories behind each of these works, that have become visual white noise for so many of the city residents and visitors.

Throughout the expansive, light-filled Center, larger-than-life historic documents and graphic images explore the facts and the myths surrounding the Bell.\r\n	\r\n	X-rays give an insider&acute;s view, literally, of the Bell&acute;s crack and inner-workings. In quiet alcoves, a short History Channel film, available in English and eight other languages, traces how abolitionists, suffragists and other groups adopted the Bell as its symbol of freedom.\r\n	\r\n	Other exhibits show how the Bell&acute;s image was used on everything from ice cream molds to wind chimes. Keep your camera handy. Soaring glass walls offer dramatic and powerful views of both the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall, just a few steps away.\r\n	<h3>History</h3>\r\n	\r\n	The bell now called the Liberty Bell was cast in the Whitechapel Foundry in the East End of London and sent to the building currently known as Independence Hall, then the Pennsylvania State House, in 1753.\r\n	\r\n	It was an impressive looking object, 12 feet in circumference around the lip with a 44-pound clapper. Inscribed at the top was part of a Biblical verse from Leviticus, “Proclaim Liberty throughout all the Land unto all the Inhabitants thereof.”\r\n	\r\n	Unfortunately, the clapper cracked the bell on its first use. A couple of local artisans, John Pass and John Stow, recast the bell twice, once adding more copper to make it less brittle and then adding silver to sweeten its tone. No one was quite satisfied, but it was put in the tower of the State House anyway.\r\n	<h3>Fast Facts </h3>\r\n	\r\n	The Liberty Bell is composed of approximately 70 percent copper, 25 percent tin and traces of lead, zinc, arsenic, gold and silver.\r\n	\r\n	The Bell is suspended from what is believed to be its original yoke, made of American elm.\r\n	\r\n	The Liberty Bell weighs 2,080 pounds. The yoke weighs about 100 pounds.','The Liberty Bell Center','','publish','open','closed','','the-liberty-bell-center','','','2016-06-08 22:40:22','2016-06-08 22:40:22','','0','http://dev.vinehurst.com/places/united-states/minnesota/sebeka/the-liberty-bell-center/','0','gd_place','','0'), ('36','1','2016-06-08 22:40:24','2016-06-08 22:40:24','\r\n	\r\n	Unlike the other squares, the early Southwest Square was never used as a burial ground, although it offered pasturage for local livestock and a convenient dumping spot for “night soil”.\r\n	<h3> History </h3>\r\n	\r\n	By the late 1700s the square was surrounded by brickyards as the area&acute;s clay terrain was better suited for kilns than crops. In 1825 the square was renamed in honor of Philadelphian David Rittenhouse, the brilliant astronomer, instrument maker and patriotic leader of the Revolutionary era.\r\n	\r\n	A building boom began by the 1850s, and in the second half of the 19th century the Rittenhouse Square neighborhood became the most fashionable residential section of the city, the home of Philadelphia&acute;s “Victorian aristocracy.” Some mansions from that period still survive on the streets facing the square, although most of the grand homes gave way to apartment buildings after 1913.\r\n	\r\n	In 1816, local residents loaned funds to the city to buy a fence to enclose Rittenhouse Square. In the decade before the Civil War, the Square boasted not only trees and walkways, but also fountains donated by local benefactors – prematurely, it turned out, for the fountains created so much mud that City Council ordered them removed. The square&acute;s present layout dates from 1913, when the newly formed Rittenhouse Square Improvement Association helped fund a redesign by Paul Philippe Cret, a French-born architect who contributed to the design of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway and the Rodin Museum. Although some changes have been made since then, the square still reflects Cret&acute;s original plan.\r\n	\r\n	<h3>Layout </h3>\r\n	\r\n	The main walkways are diagonal, beginning at the corners and meeting at a central oval. The plaza, which contains a large planter bed and a reflecting pool, is surrounded by a balustrade and ringed by a circular walk. Classical urns, many bearing relief figures of ancient Greeks, rest on pedestals at the entrances and elsewhere throughout the square. Ornamental lampposts contribute to an air of old-fashioned gentility. A low fence surrounds the square, and balustrades adorn the corner entrances. Oaks, maples, locusts, plane trees, and others stand within and around the enclosure, and the flowerbeds and blooming shrubs add a splash of color in season.\r\n	\r\n	Rittenhouse Square is the site of annual flower markets and outdoor art exhibitions. More than any of the other squares, it also functions as a neighborhood park. Office workers eat their lunches on the benches; parents bring children to play; and many people stroll through to admire the plants, sculptures, or the fat and saucy squirrels.\r\n	\r\n	<h3>Public Art </h3>\r\n	\r\n	Like Logan Square, you can see several of the city&acute;s best-loved outdoor sculptures in Rittenhouse Square. The dramatic Lion Crushing a Serpent by the French Romantic sculptor Antoine-Louis Barye is in the central plaza. Originally created in 1832, the work is Barye&acute;s allegory of the French Revolution of 1830, symbolizing the power of good (the lion) conquering evil (the serpent). This bronze cast was made about 1890.\r\n	\r\n	At the other end of the central plaza, within the reflecting pool, is Paul Manship&acute;s Duck Girl of 1911, a lyrical bronze of a young girl carrying a duck under one arm – an early work by the same sculptor who designed the Aero Memorial for Logan Square. A favorite of the children is Albert Laessle&acute;s Billy, a two-foot-high bronze billy goat in a small plaza halfway down the southwest walk. Billy&acute;s head, horns, and spine have been worn to a shiny gold color by countless small admirers.\r\n	\r\n	In a similar plaza in the northeast walkway stands the Evelyn Taylor Price Memorial Sundial, a sculpture of two cheerful, naked children who hold aloft a sundial in the form of a giant sunflower head. Created by Philadelphia artist Beatrice Fenton, the sundial memorializes a woman who served as the president of the Rittenhouse Square Improvement Association and Rittenhouse Square Flower Association. In the flower bed between the sundial and the central plaza is Cornelia Van A. Chapin&acute;s Giant Frog, a large and sleek granite amphibian. Continuing the animal theme, two small stone dogs, added in 1988, perch on the balustrades at the southwest corner entrance.\r\n	\r\n	<h3>At Night </h3>\r\n	\r\n	Once predominantly a daytime destination, Rittenhouse Square is now a popular nightspot as well, with a string of restaurants - including Rouge, Devon, Parc and Barclay Prime - that have sprouted up along the east side of the park on 18th Street.\r\n	\r\n	So these days, you can take in the serenity of the natural landscape from a park bench in the sunshine and then sip cocktails under the stars at one of many candlelit outdoor tables.\r\n	\r\n	Meanwhile, several more restaurants, bars and clubs have opened along the surrounding blocks in recent years, like Parc, Tria, Continental Midtown, Alfa, Walnut Room, and Twenty Manning just to name a few.\r\n	','Rittenhouse Square','','publish','open','closed','','rittenhouse-square','','','2016-06-08 22:40:24','2016-06-08 22:40:24','','0','http://dev.vinehurst.com/places/united-states/minnesota/sebeka/rittenhouse-square/','0','gd_place','','0'), ('44','1','2013-08-03 23:45:40','2013-08-03 23:45:40','','Home','','publish','open','open','','home','','','2013-08-03 23:45:40','2013-08-03 23:45:40','','0','http://realhomes.inspirythemes.com/?page_id=44','0','page','','0'), ('42','1','2013-08-03 23:45:23','2013-08-03 23:45:23','','News','','publish','open','open','','news','','','2013-08-03 23:45:23','2013-08-03 23:45:23','','0','http://realhomes.inspirythemes.com/?page_id=42','0','page','','0'), ('896','1','2016-06-15 21:54:08','2016-06-15 21:54:08','Chris Anderson is the President and CEO of Vinehurst, one of the leading M&amp;A Advisory Firms in the United States.

While many M&amp;A firms recommend a \"broad stroke\" process to selling a business, many private business owners seek to strike a balance between a premium price for their business and a process which is more discreet and limits disruption to the business.  In this competitive business environment, maintaining confidentiality and controlling the flow of company information is of paramount importance.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor corporate divestitures, objectives in a transaction can vary from those of private business owners. Speed and certainty of close are often high priority elements of a corporate divestiture process.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhether it is a private sale or a corporate divestiture, a customized sale process with appropriate advance screening of potential buyers can meet varying client objectives.  We commit to understand the individual goals of each of our client’s and then recommend a transaction and a strategy that best satisfies those goals.\r\n<h3>Corporate Development Services</h3>\r\nWhile many companies are interested in expanding through acquisition, partnering or joint venture arrangements, they are often reluctant to invest in a dedicated corporate development group at the company or the current group is busy with other responsibilities. At Vinehurst, we can provide corporate development services on an outsourced basis or we can provide assistance to an existing group on a project basis. Where appropriate, we can also assist a company in establishing an internal corporate development group. We have worked with in-house corporate development groups at a variety of companies and we have developed a best practices approach to the corporate development function.\r\n<h3>Other Advisory Services</h3>\r\nWe understand that companies often require assistance with unique situations that go beyond a straight forward sale or acquisition of a business. These situations often require some level of advisory support, but may not require the full menu of services provided by an M&amp;A advisor. We can be flexible in terms of our engagements, including fee structures, based on the specific needs of the client. We have the interest, flexibility and experience to advise companies on any of the following situations:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Representing a seller or buyer in an exclusive negotiation with a single counter party;</li>\r\n 	<li>Assisting a CFO in raising or refinancing a senior debt facility;</li>\r\n 	<li>Raising subordinated debt or equity for acquisitions, liquidity or growth;</li>\r\n 	<li>Assisting a management team in a buyout from a corporate parent or private owner;</li>\r\n 	<li>Assisting an individual or corporate shareholder in buying out other shareholder(s); or</li>\r\n 	<li>Other services such as strategic alternatives analysis and M&amp;A related valuations.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFind out today if you qualify for our representation.','Services','','publish','closed','closed','','services','','','2016-06-19 23:12:56','2016-06-19 23:12:56','','0','http://dev.vinehurst.com/?page_id=901','0','page','','0'), ('902','1','2016-06-17 18:22:08','2016-06-17 18:22:08','<strong>Can\'t I sell my business on my own?</strong>\r\n\r\nAn experienced acquisition team can easily outmaneuver a business owner. The best thing a business owner can do to maximize the take home during a business sale or recapitalization process is to focus on running the operations of the business at peak performance. You will put yourself at a severe disadvantage if you attempt to negotiate on your own against experienced acquirers and/or experienced M &amp; A professionals representing acquirers. Without a capable M&amp;A advisor, the deal making process can be strenuous and take much of your attention from the business. It is best to have an experienced professional help you negotiate.\r\n\r\nAnother important factor that most sellers do not realize is the grueling nature and length of the business sale process even after the price and terms are established. Most deals take months to close even after a buyer is found and a LOI is agreed upon. If your business suffers due to the reduced attention during this lengthy business sale process, the acquirers will seize the opportunity to renegotiate the deal. Any drop in the business performance will adversely effect the valuation of your business and many times kill the deal. Unless you believe you can effectively do the duties of an M&amp; A Advisor <strong>without losing the focus of the business</strong>, attempting to market the business by yourself would not be a wise choice.\r\n\r\n<strong>What are the top 3 mistakes that business sellers make?</strong>\r\n\r\nThe most expensive mistake that sellers make is not taking the time to plan a sale. If you have to sell in a hurry, the chances are pretty slim that you will get what you deserve.\r\n\r\nThe second most expensive mistake that sellers make is that they get themselves into a single buyer auction. This typically  happens when the seller got an unsolicited bid from an industry player. The other common situation is when a seller tells his banker or CPA or attorney that he is planning on selling and the well meaning counsel introduces the seller to someone who is looking to buy a business. Regardless of the reason, if there is just a single player determining the value of your business, you are very likely to get an offer that is well below the market price.\r\n\r\nThe third most expensive mistake that sellers make is taking the eye off the ball during the business sale process. This tends to be not only expensive but traumatic as the buyer renegotiates price and terms of a deal that you think is done. If you have a reason to believe your business is worth over a million dollars, engage an M&amp;A consultant, plan the process and get the most out of your business by getting multiple buyer to the table and negotiating the best deal.\r\n\r\n<strong>How do I find out what my company is worth?</strong>\r\n\r\nIn any business sale or recapitalization transaction, the value of a business is determined by the acquirer. While we may communicate with you on what we perceive is the likely range of values for your business, we rarely take the first step in giving out an asking price to acquirers. Depending on the company, the strategic value of the business can be far in excess of what the cash flow may indicate.\r\n\r\nContact Chris for more information on how businesses are valued in real life transactions. Getting the right acquirer to the table and finding out what a business is worth to them and getting them to pay a premium is one of the most challenging aspects of an M&amp;A advisors job.\r\n\r\n<strong>What are the three most important factors that improve the value of a business deal?</strong>\r\n\r\nStrategic fit, growth rates and recurring revenues are the three most important value drivers for most businesses. Check with Chris for tips on how you can improve your business valuation.\r\n\r\n<strong>What are the three most important factors that reduce the value of a business deal?</strong>\r\n\r\nUnanticipated or undisclosed downside during the deal process is very likely the single largest value killer in a business sale. Customer concentration and risk of business transferability are two other important facts that drive down the value of a business.\r\n\r\n<strong>What can an M&amp;A advisor do to improve the business valuation?</strong>\r\n\r\nPreparing a business for sale and improving  your business valuation is one of the areas in which a competent M&amp;A advisor such as Mr. Anderson can make a huge difference. Businesses typically spend an inordinate amount of time setting up and using accounting practices that reduce the owner’s tax liabilities. CPAs use various business ownership structures and techniques to defer/reduce the revenues or accelerate/inflate the expenses to help business reduce its tax burden. The unforeseen side effect of this exercise is that, to a potential acquirer, the profitability of the business may appear much smaller than what it really is. There may also be other after-sale tax consequences attributable to corporate structure and to depreciation. Business intermediaries “add-back” non-business, non-cash expenses and “recast” the financial statements to get a better picture of the finances, but in most cases this is more of a band-aid than a real solution.\r\n\r\n<strong>What is the difference between Net Income, SDCF, EBIT, and EBITDA?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNet Income (NI), Seller Discretionary Cash Flow (SDCF), Earnings Before Interest &amp; Taxes (EBIT) and Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation &amp; Amortization (EBITDA) are different ways of measuring a company\'s profitability.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What are the liquidity or financing options for mid market business owners?</strong>\r\n\r\nMid market owners typical gain liquidity throw debt or equity capital or by doing an outright sale of the business. Ask Chris for a more detailed explanation of the options and trade-offs.\r\n\r\n<strong>Who are PEGs? Does it make sense to sell my business to a PEG?</strong>\r\n\r\nPEG stands for Private Equity Group. PEGs are one of the important sources of liquidity for mid market business owners but not the only source. Vinehurst targets PEGs along with other possible acquirers for your company to make sure your deal attracts the most qualified buyers and get a competitive bidding process going.\r\n\r\n<strong><strong>What is a typical sales process?</strong></strong>\r\n\r\nWe typically customize the sales process for each company depending on the needs of the business owner. For smaller companies, the business sales process can be fairly straight forward and the sale may be consummated in a few months.\r\n\r\n<strong>How long will it take to sell my business?</strong>\r\n\r\nThe time needed to sell your business depends on a great many factors, including your expectation of value for your business, the type of business, your willingness to finance all or part of the purchase price, and market conditions. The<strong>business sales process</strong> for a small business, in most instances, can be completed in less than a year. The sale process for mid-market company can be a year long process or more.  Depending on the business owners goals, geographic location, market conditions and the negotiating process, we have had deals close in as little as three months and we have had deals take as much as three years. Let Vinehurst explain how your business fits into these general guidelines.\r\n\r\n<strong>When is it a good time to sell my business?</strong>\r\n\r\nThe right time to sell a company is during a period of good financial performance. For most sellers, timing is largely driven by your personal motivations more than any other factors. Keep in mind that acquirers typically like to buy businesses when sales and profits are holding steady or increasing. A big mistake many sellers make is to continue running their business well after they are capable of running it efficiently. Elite highly recommends that business owners invest time inexit planning to do the deal on their terms and to maximize their take home.\r\n\r\n<strong>What is the difference between an M&amp;A advisory firm and an investment bank?</strong>\r\n\r\nInvestment banks typically focus on stock placement and underwriting securities. In addition to providing M&amp;A advisory services, investment banks may maintain broker/dealer operations and maintain markets for previously issued securities. Investment Bankers specialize on large business with revenues over $100 million. Investment Bankers typically do not do transaction where the fee is less than a million dollars.\r\n\r\n<strong>How are mid-market M&amp;A specialists different from business brokers?</strong>\r\n\r\nBusiness brokers concentrate on businesses under $1 million and cater to the local retail market. Business brokers are also typically dual agents (i.e. represent both buyers and sellers in the same transaction).  When it comes to the midmarket transactions, business brokers are typically unaware of the M&amp;A process and work by pricing business at an industry standard multiple of cash flow. The cash flow multiple method ignores the strategic aspects of the business and typically undervalues larger businesses by substantial margin. M&amp;A specialists have substantially different and sophisticated methods to value and market businesses.\r\n\r\n<strong>How does Vinehurst find buyers?</strong>\r\n\r\nOur buyer search is tailored to each company. First, we develop a customized marketing strategy and campaign for your business. Next, we utilize several custom databases to identify strategic, financial and high net worth acquirers who are well suited to acquire a business such as yours. The pool of acquirers includes buyers who have approached us in the past and are now part of our qualified buyers database. We also network with other intermediaries and professionals through various organizations. Strategic acquirers are typically targeted and approached by direct mail or telephone. Other marketing methods may include newspaper advertising, trade publication advertising, and ads placed on high traffic M&amp;A websites. All of the marketing is done discretely to protect your business interests.\r\n\r\n<strong>A company/individual has approached me and wants to buy my business? Do I still need a M&amp;A Representative?</strong>\r\n\r\nYes! Our experience indicates that going with a single buyer can adversely affect the value you can get for your company dramatically. An M&amp;A representative can help maximize the value of your company as well as your take home.\r\n\r\n<strong><strong>What types of offers should I expect to receive?</strong></strong>\r\n\r\nAstute acquirers are going to structure the initial offer to leave sufficient room for negotiations. Therefore, you should expect to receive low initial offers. All offers will contain some important contingencies, including review of the financial books and records of the business, obtaining a satisfactory lease, agreement on training, and transition periods. Other contingencies specific to your business may also be included. Contingencies are normal and provide the buyer with the opportunity to verify the information presented in the marketing materials.\r\n\r\n<strong>Do I need to provide any financing for the buyer?</strong>\r\n\r\nGiven a chance, most business owners would like to cash out 100% at the close of escrow. However, overwhelming amount of transactional data indicates that sellers willing to carry a part of the purchase price as a note receive substantially higher valuations than sellers that do not. Acquirers and their lenders see seller-financing as the seller\'s vote of confidence in this business, and in your ability to successfully transition it to your chosen buyer. Seller\'s willingness to provide financing will enhance the prospects of selling your company in a timely manner. If Vinehurst is given the flexibility in terms of seller carry, we are confident that we will put together a deal that has the best combination of price and terms that meet your needs.\r\n\r\n<strong>How will I be protected on any personal financing I provide to the buyer?</strong>\r\n\r\nThe closing escrow agent can prepare a promissory note, a security agreement and will file a UCC-1 financing statement with the appropriate state and local agencies if applicable. It is much like financing a car - the lien can be recorded in the public records and the assets listed on the UCC-1 cannot be legally sold or refinanced without your permission.\r\n\r\n<strong>I want to keep the sale of my business confidential. I don\'t want my employees, customers and vendors to know that my business is for sale. What steps do you take to ensure confidentiality?</strong>\r\n\r\nMost sellers share your concern. Our discrete process and procedures are designed to protect confidentiality. Some examples:\r\n-All interested acquirers must sign confidentiality agreements and must be qualified before any detailed information is disclosed about your company, including its identity.\r\n-All external advertisements for your business are written in a discreet format and do not contain enough information to allow someone to determine that it is your company that is for sale.\r\n-All materials, descriptions, financial statements, and marketing materials are pre-approved by you.\r\n\r\n<strong>Do I need a lawyer and/or an accountant?</strong>\r\n\r\nVinehurst does not take the place of a lawyer or accountant. You are encouraged to seek legal and tax advisory services prior to closing any business transaction. We highly recommend that the attorneys and CPAs you use for the sale or purchase of a business be well experienced in M&amp;A transactions. Over the years, we have worked with many qualified professionals in this area - we can refer you to them if needed.\r\n\r\n<strong>How long is the training period for the buyer?</strong>\r\n\r\nGenerally, you will be expected to provide two weeks to two months of training in the business with equal time of telephone consultation. If you are financing any portion of the purchase price, as is common in a lot of deals, you still have an investment in the business, so properly training the acquirer is in your best interest.\r\n\r\n<strong>Will I have to sign a non-compete agreement?</strong>\r\n\r\nTypically, yes. The type of non-compete agreement depends on the type of business you are in.\r\n\r\n<strong>When should I tell my employees about the sale?</strong>\r\n\r\nOur considerable experience has proven that it is best to tell your employees about the sale immediately before or immediately after the sale is complete. Of course, if there is an employee whose expertise will be needed after the sale, you should introduce the buyer to this employee shortly before closing.\r\n\r\n<strong>What is expected from a seller in order for Vinehurst to conduct a valuation and to start marketing a business?</strong>\r\n\r\nThe information disclosure requirements for companies vary depend on the type of business. However, most businesses are expected to provide:\r\n• 3-5 years income tax returns, income statements, and balance sheets.\r\n• Current list of equipment, fixtures, and inventory.\r\n• A copy of real estate leases\r\n• Information about property or real estate owned or used by the business.\r\n• Breakdown of employees with titles, salaries and a short biography for each member of the management team.\r\n• Photographs of facilities, equipment, and location, etc.\r\n• Summary documentation for any patents, intellectual property, etc.\r\n• Marketing materials such as copies of advertisements, articles, Yellow Pages ads, newspaper articles, etc.\r\n• Other documentation specific to your business that you believe may have an impact on value.\r\nElite will provide you with a list of required documents and materials. Elite may also require that you participate in a thorough interview allowing us to learn about your business to effectively represent you and your company.\r\n\r\n<strong>How does Vinehurst get paid?</strong>\r\n\r\nWe are paid for mainly on a success basis and therefore receive a transaction fee at the close of the transaction. Depending on the transaction, we also work with customers on a retainer basis with modest upfront fee and lowered success fee.\r\n\r\n<strong>What can I do to help sell my business?</strong>\r\n\r\nSome examples of things you can do to help Vinehurst after we begin the process of selling your business are:\r\n• Provide us with required information in a timely manner.\r\n• Be as accommodating as possible in setting appointments to meet with buyers.\r\n• Conduct business as usual - Keep normal working hours and continue with business as you normally would\r\n• Make sure your financial records are an accurate reflection of revenues, expenses and assets/liability levels.\r\n• Do not let inventory levels dip below normal or delay asset purchases beyond what is reasonable.\r\n• Keep all aspects of the business clean and in good repair.\r\n• Remove equipment or furniture that is not part of the sale.\r\n\r\n<strong>I want to buy a business. How do I proceed?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFirst, contact us to introduce yourself. Vinehurst will work with you to understand your needs and explore the possibilities. We then provide you the necessary forms such as an Engagement Agreement, Statement of Business Experience, andStatement of Financial Background for you to complete. Once we identify opportunities that fit your needs we will contact you to explore the opportunities and zero in on the opportunity that best fits your needs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Why must I sign confidentiality agreement and provide </strong><strong>resume</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>financial statement</strong>?\r\n\r\nWe are dedicated to servicing the confidentiality needs of our clients. Signing the confidentiality agreement is a painless process in which you promise not to disclose any information that we give you about a business, including the business name, owner information, employee names, etc. Breaches or leaks of confidential information can cause customers to move on, employees to quit, and vendors and lenders to get nervous. This can be detrimental to both the seller and potential acquirer.\r\n\r\nIt is important for acquirers to understand the role of the M&amp;A Advisor and the nature of the merger and acquisition business. Unlike real estate transactions where the “for sale” sign is posted on the property, the business intermediary must act to preserve confidentiality. Breach of confidentiality may cause serious damage to the client. Transaction size and strategic objectives often set the bar for the determining which types of acquirers the seller is willing to consider. To ensure confidentiality and meet strategic goals, a business must be shown only to “qualified” potential acquirers. Non disclosure, Experience, and Financial statements are all important factors in determining the proper fit for a given transaction.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Note:</strong> We provide you with a free preliminary valuation of your company at the beginning of the process. Our years of experience, valuation methods, and review of comparable sales of privately held companies will provide you with a valuation range indicating what your company could sell for in today\'s market. However, keep in mind that initial valuation is only an estimate and the final value of your transaction will depend on the marketing methods, negotiating skills, business environment, deal structure and numerous other factors.','FAQS','','publish','closed','closed','','faqs','','','2016-06-17 18:22:08','2016-06-17 18:22:08','','0','http://dev.vinehurst.com/?page_id=902','0','page','','0'), ('903','1','2016-06-17 18:26:44','2016-06-17 18:26:44','If you’re seriously evaluating your exit strategy, managing the process through a professional may help. Having a third party involved to represent your firm often lends credence by serving as an indication that you\'re serious about selling.\r\nDepending on your size, you may choose a business brokerage or an investment bank. Both help you accurately gauge market interest, bring potential buyers to the table and create a bidding process to get you the best offer. In addition, such an intermediary will be able to guide you through the process – from signing a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) with a prospective buyer to help in structuring a transaction.\r\n\r\nOr, you can sell the business yourself. Whether or not you use an intermediary, arm yourself with a business valuation and good advisors. Here are 10 ways to better prepare for the sale.\r\n<h4>1. Get Your Books in Order:</h4>\r\nFinancial statements are the best indicator of the future performance of a business. Buyers evaluating your company will generally require at least three years\' worth of financial information. The more formal your statements (accountant-reviewed or -prepared vs. internally generated), the better the impression you\'ll make and the easier the due diligence for a buyer. Audited financial statements are ideal. Having a top notch business plan to accompany your financials will increase your credibility with potential buyers.\r\n<h4>2. Grow Your Business to Sell It:</h4>\r\nIt is always easier to sell a business whose sales are growing than one in a downward trend or even flat. Buyers generally want to invest in a company that will provide them with a good return, so they’re willing to pay more for a business that has a positive trend and outlook. If the company\'s future success appears to be threatened (a competitor entering the market, technological advances outdating company products, etc.), the value of the business will be affected. The marketability of the firm may decline as well.\r\n<h4>3. Evaluate the Impact of External Factors:</h4>\r\nThe climate in which a business operates can also affect its valuation and marketability. An overall economic downturn can result in the tightening of corporate belts and a reduction in acquisition activity. In the same manner, a decline within a specific industry or geographic region can also prompt a diminished appetite for private-company acquisitions in those areas. Additionally, a decrease in a public company’s price/earnings ratios tends to produce a corresponding \"trickle down\" effect for the multiples paid for private companies.\r\n<h4>4. Valuing Your Business – Using Multiples:</h4>\r\nThere is an abundance of available data on common industry \"multiples\" that can be used to estimate a business\'s value. Over time, valuation experts and investment bankers have observed trends in the selling price of businesses. Multiples are simply a summary version of these trends. They are industry-specific and generally used for smaller businesses. However, while multiples may be useful in providing an immediate ballpark of a business\'s value, they do not substitute for a comprehensive valuation analysis.\r\n<h4>5. Valuing Your Business – Taking Intangible Assets Into Account:</h4>\r\nWhen pricing your business for sale, intangible assets – such as people, knowledge and market position – can be even more important than tangible property. Customer awareness that underpins a prominent position within the market is a key ingredient in many companies’ success. A strong brand and a loyal customer base can be distinct assets. Other distinct intangible assets include copyrights or trademarks that let a business sell its products for a higher price or in greater quantity than its competition; proprietary mailing lists of customers or prospects; long-term contracts; and franchises with long track records and well-recognized names.\r\n<h4>6. Get a Business Valuation:</h4>\r\nA professional valuation will give you a basis for gauging offers. It will give you an idea of what you can expect to net from the sale. It will also tell you your company\'s market position, financial situation, strengths and weaknesses (which you can address prior to putting it on the market). Valuations can be obtained from a number of sources, ranging from local accounting firms to business brokers and investment banking firms. As a rule, you should make sure the company performing your valuation has access to the most current national data regarding privately held transactions in your industry. Experience in selling firms of your type is obviously helpful as well.\r\n<h4>7. Maximize Your Price:Concentrate on Core Competency:</h4>\r\nA company with a strong focus around a core business generally tends to be more appealing to a buyer than a company going many different directions. Make sure that the focus of all members of the management team is aligned in this direction and that your firm’s products and services add to the value of your core business.\r\n\r\nReduce Customer Concentration:\r\n\r\nMany small businesses can\'t help but have a handful of customers who generate a large percentage of the company\'s revenues. In general, a buyer will carefully review any client relationship that comprises more than 10% of revenues. Any efforts to reduce the level of customer concentration prior to a sale will be helpful in increasing the reliability of the firm\'s future revenue stream and will help to augment the firm\'s value.\r\n\r\nIndustry Concentration:\r\n\r\nSpecialization can give a company a competitive advantage in winning contracts through industry expertise; it can also force companies to take on risk due to lack of diversity. If an industry suffers a cyclical downturn, a company that has the preponderance of its customer base within that industry may be affected as well. There are exceptions, but industry concentration is usually viewed as undesirable.\r\n<h4>8. Know Your Buyer:</h4>\r\nFinancial buyers make up an enormous segment of the market. They look for businesses they can buy using debt financing for 50% to 75% of the price. They’re also looking for sufficient cash flow to service that debt. With few exceptions, they value a business by using a multiple of four to six times earnings before interest and taxes (after making adjustments for expenses that would not continue for a new owner). They deduct from the price any interest-bearing debt they will assume. There are disadvantages to selling to a financial buyer: There are no synergies such as access to a larger sales force, or complementary activities in production, engineering, or any other part of the business. Furthermore, there are pressures to increase the cash flow because of the added debt. Financial buyers are in business to make deals, so they often leave day-to-day operations unchanged. But they buy with a view to selling, which could disrupt your business life a second time.\r\n\r\nStrategic buyers expect synergies with their other holdings. They can afford to pay a premium, but they may not need to because they know the market. Buyers offering premium prices are in short supply. The best match sometimes comes about when they seek you out after having determined that your business fits their plans. Strategic buyers may diminish your role, however, and their goals may differ from yours.\r\n<h4>9. Plan for Management Succession:</h4>\r\nIf you\'re absolutely vital to your business, who will a buyer be able to turn to for help running things after you leave? Efforts should be made to gradually delegate key responsibilities (primarily those related to customer relationships and other direct ties to revenue generation) to various members of the senior management team. A buyer\'s primary concern is that the business can operate successfully in the absence of the current executive.\r\n<h4>10. Get Your Ducks in Row:</h4>\r\nGet an advisory team in place that includes an attorney and accountant who are proficient in mergers and acquisitions. Organize your legal paperwork. Many privately held companies conduct business on an informal, or \"handshake,\" basis with customers and vendors. Informal agreements, however, can result in a discount to value – particularly when they are key to the company\'s success. Formal agreements can ensure the continuity of key relationships, giving a buyer peace of mind that the company\'s customer and supplier relationships (and therefore cash flow) are secure.\r\n\r\nIn addition, review your incorporation papers, permits, licensing agreements and leases. Make sure you have them readily available, current and in order. Make a good first impression. Insure that when prospective buyers visit, they see an orderly operation instead of one that is chaotic. And no matter what, keep your eye on the ball. Don\'t let your business performance decline because you\'re too focused on the sale. This will only give buyers additional negotiating power to lower their offers.','10 Tips on Selling Your Business','','publish','open','open','','10-tips-on-selling-your-business','','','2016-06-19 23:12:43','2016-06-19 23:12:43','','0','http://dev.vinehurst.com/?p=903','0','post','','0'), ('904','1','2016-06-17 18:20:34','2016-06-17 18:20:34','<h3>What we do</h3>\r\nVinehurst is an ultra exclusive brokerage boutique. 9 out of every 10 who apply to have Vinehurst represent their business sale are declined, based on our strict qualifying criteria.  We only represent clients who have operated a successful business and/or possess an amazing strategic acquisition.

The best thing a business owner can do to maximize the take home during a business sale or recapitalization process is to focus on running the operations of the business at peak performance. You will put yourself at a severe disadvantage if you attempt to negotiate on your own against experienced acquirers and/or experienced M &amp; A professionals representing acquirers. Without a capable M&amp;A advisor, the deal making process can be strenuous and take much of your attention from the business. It is best to have an experienced professional help you negotiate.\r\n\r\nAnother important factor that most sellers do not realize is the grueling nature and length of the business sale process even after the price and terms are established. Most deals take months to close even after a buyer is found and a LOI is agreed upon. If your business suffers due to the reduced attention during this lengthy business sale process, the acquirers will seize the opportunity to renegotiate the deal. Any drop in the business performance will adversely effect the valuation of your business and many times kill the deal. Unless you believe you can effectively do the duties of an M&amp; A Advisor <strong>without losing the focus of the business</strong>, attempting to market the business by yourself would not be a wise choice.\r\n\r\n<strong>What are the top 3 mistakes that business sellers make?</strong>\r\n\r\nThe most expensive mistake that sellers make is not taking the time to plan a sale. If you have to sell in a hurry, the chances are pretty slim that you will get what you deserve.\r\n\r\nThe second most expensive mistake that sellers make is that they get themselves into a single buyer auction. This typically  happens when the seller got an unsolicited bid from an industry player. The other common situation is when a seller tells his banker or CPA or attorney that he is planning on selling and the well meaning counsel introduces the seller to someone who is looking to buy a business. Regardless of the reason, if there is just a single player determining the value of your business, you are very likely to get an offer that is well below the market price.\r\n\r\nThe third most expensive mistake that sellers make is taking the eye off the ball during the business sale process. This tends to be not only expensive but traumatic as the buyer renegotiates price and terms of a deal that you think is done. If you have a reason to believe your business is worth over a million dollars, engage an M&amp;A consultant, plan the process and get the most out of your business by getting multiple buyer to the table and negotiating the best deal.\r\n\r\n<strong>How do I find out what my company is worth?</strong>\r\n\r\nIn any business sale or recapitalization transaction, the value of a business is determined by the acquirer. While we may communicate with you on what we perceive is the likely range of values for your business, we rarely take the first step in giving out an asking price to acquirers. Depending on the company, the strategic value of the business can be far in excess of what the cash flow may indicate.\r\n\r\nContact Chris for more information on how businesses are valued in real life transactions. Getting the right acquirer to the table and finding out what a business is worth to them and getting them to pay a premium is one of the most challenging aspects of an M&amp;A advisors job.\r\n\r\n<strong>What are the three most important factors that improve the value of a business deal?</strong>\r\n\r\nStrategic fit, growth rates and recurring revenues are the three most important value drivers for most businesses. Check with Chris for tips on how you can improve your business valuation.\r\n\r\n<strong>What are the three most important factors that reduce the value of a business deal?</strong>\r\n\r\nUnanticipated or undisclosed downside during the deal process is very likely the single largest value killer in a business sale. Customer concentration and risk of business transferability are two other important facts that drive down the value of a business.\r\n\r\n<strong>What can an M&amp;A advisor do to improve the business valuation?</strong>\r\n\r\nPreparing a business for sale and improving  your business valuation is one of the areas in which a competent M&amp;A advisor such as Mr. Anderson can make a huge difference. Businesses typically spend an inordinate amount of time setting up and using accounting practices that reduce the owner’s tax liabilities. CPAs use various business ownership structures and techniques to defer/reduce the revenues or accelerate/inflate the expenses to help business reduce its tax burden. The unforeseen side effect of this exercise is that, to a potential acquirer, the profitability of the business may appear much smaller than what it really is. There may also be other after-sale tax consequences attributable to corporate structure and to depreciation. Business intermediaries “add-back” non-business, non-cash expenses and “recast” the financial statements to get a better picture of the finances, but in most cases this is more of a band-aid than a real solution.\r\n\r\n<strong>What is the difference between Net Income, SDCF, EBIT, and EBITDA?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNet Income (NI), Seller Discretionary Cash Flow (SDCF), Earnings Before Interest &amp; Taxes (EBIT) and Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation &amp; Amortization (EBITDA) are different ways of measuring a company\'s profitability.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>What are the liquidity or financing options for mid market business owners?</strong>\r\n\r\nMid market owners typical gain liquidity throw debt or equity capital or by doing an outright sale of the business. Ask Chris for a more detailed explanation of the options and trade-offs.\r\n\r\n<strong>Who are PEGs? Does it make sense to sell my business to a PEG?</strong>\r\n\r\nPEG stands for Private Equity Group. PEGs are one of the important sources of liquidity for mid market business owners but not the only source. Vinehurst targets PEGs along with other possible acquirers for your company to make sure your deal attracts the most qualified buyers and get a competitive bidding process going.\r\n\r\n<strong><strong>What is a typical sales process?</strong></strong>\r\n\r\nWe typically customize the sales process for each company depending on the needs of the business owner. For smaller companies, the business sales process can be fairly straight forward and the sale may be consummated in a few months.\r\n\r\n<strong>How long will it take to sell my business?</strong>\r\n\r\nThe time needed to sell your business depends on a great many factors, including your expectation of value for your business, the type of business, your willingness to finance all or part of the purchase price, and market conditions. The<strong>business sales process</strong> for a small business, in most instances, can be completed in less than a year. The sale process for mid-market company can be a year long process or more.  Depending on the business owners goals, geographic location, market conditions and the negotiating process, we have had deals close in as little as three months and we have had deals take as much as three years. Let Vinehurst explain how your business fits into these general guidelines.\r\n\r\n<strong>When is it a good time to sell my business?</strong>\r\n\r\nThe right time to sell a company is during a period of good financial performance. For most sellers, timing is largely driven by your personal motivations more than any other factors. Keep in mind that acquirers typically like to buy businesses when sales and profits are holding steady or increasing. A big mistake many sellers make is to continue running their business well after they are capable of running it efficiently. Elite highly recommends that business owners invest time inexit planning to do the deal on their terms and to maximize their take home.\r\n\r\n<strong>What is the difference between an M&amp;A advisory firm and an investment bank?</strong>\r\n\r\nInvestment banks typically focus on stock placement and underwriting securities. In addition to providing M&amp;A advisory services, investment banks may maintain broker/dealer operations and maintain markets for previously issued securities. Investment Bankers specialize on large business with revenues over $100 million. Investment Bankers typically do not do transaction where the fee is less than a million dollars.\r\n\r\n<strong>How are mid-market M&amp;A specialists different from business brokers?</strong>\r\n\r\nBusiness brokers concentrate on businesses under $1 million and cater to the local retail market. Business brokers are also typically dual agents (i.e. represent both buyers and sellers in the same transaction).  When it comes to the midmarket transactions, business brokers are typically unaware of the M&amp;A process and work by pricing business at an industry standard multiple of cash flow. The cash flow multiple method ignores the strategic aspects of the business and typically undervalues larger businesses by substantial margin. M&amp;A specialists have substantially different and sophisticated methods to value and market businesses.\r\n\r\n<strong>How does Vinehurst find buyers?</strong>\r\n\r\nOur buyer search is tailored to each company. First, we develop a customized marketing strategy and campaign for your business. Next, we utilize several custom databases to identify strategic, financial and high net worth acquirers who are well suited to acquire a business such as yours. The pool of acquirers includes buyers who have approached us in the past and are now part of our qualified buyers database. We also network with other intermediaries and professionals through various organizations. Strategic acquirers are typically targeted and approached by direct mail or telephone. Other marketing methods may include newspaper advertising, trade publication advertising, and ads placed on high traffic M&amp;A websites. All of the marketing is done discretely to protect your business interests.\r\n\r\n<strong>A company/individual has approached me and wants to buy my business? Do I still need a M&amp;A Representative?</strong>\r\n\r\nYes! Our experience indicates that going with a single buyer can adversely affect the value you can get for your company dramatically. An M&amp;A representative can help maximize the value of your company as well as your take home.\r\n\r\n<strong><strong>What types of offers should I expect to receive?</strong></strong>\r\n\r\nAstute acquirers are going to structure the initial offer to leave sufficient room for negotiations. Therefore, you should expect to receive low initial offers. All offers will contain some important contingencies, including review of the financial books and records of the business, obtaining a satisfactory lease, agreement on training, and transition periods. Other contingencies specific to your business may also be included. Contingencies are normal and provide the buyer with the opportunity to verify the information presented in the marketing materials.\r\n\r\n<strong>Do I need to provide any financing for the buyer?</strong>\r\n\r\nGiven a chance, most business owners would like to cash out 100% at the close of escrow. However, overwhelming amount of transactional data indicates that sellers willing to carry a part of the purchase price as a note receive substantially higher valuations than sellers that do not. Acquirers and their lenders see seller-financing as the seller\'s vote of confidence in this business, and in your ability to successfully transition it to your chosen buyer. Seller\'s willingness to provide financing will enhance the prospects of selling your company in a timely manner. If Vinehurst is given the flexibility in terms of seller carry, we are confident that we will put together a deal that has the best combination of price and terms that meet your needs.\r\n\r\n<strong>How will I be protected on any personal financing I provide to the buyer?</strong>\r\n\r\nThe closing escrow agent can prepare a promissory note, a security agreement and will file a UCC-1 financing statement with the appropriate state and local agencies if applicable. It is much like financing a car - the lien can be recorded in the public records and the assets listed on the UCC-1 cannot be legally sold or refinanced without your permission.\r\n\r\n<strong>I want to keep the sale of my business confidential. I don\'t want my employees, customers and vendors to know that my business is for sale. What steps do you take to ensure confidentiality?</strong>\r\n\r\nMost sellers share your concern. Our discrete process and procedures are designed to protect confidentiality. Some examples:\r\n-All interested acquirers must sign confidentiality agreements and must be qualified before any detailed information is disclosed about your company, including its identity.\r\n-All external advertisements for your business are written in a discreet format and do not contain enough information to allow someone to determine that it is your company that is for sale.\r\n-All materials, descriptions, financial statements, and marketing materials are pre-approved by you.\r\n\r\n<strong>Do I need a lawyer and/or an accountant?</strong>\r\n\r\nVinehurst does not take the place of a lawyer or accountant. You are encouraged to seek legal and tax advisory services prior to closing any business transaction. We highly recommend that the attorneys and CPAs you use for the sale or purchase of a business be well experienced in M&amp;A transactions. Over the years, we have worked with many qualified professionals in this area - we can refer you to them if needed.\r\n\r\n<strong>How long is the training period for the buyer?</strong>\r\n\r\nGenerally, you will be expected to provide two weeks to two months of training in the business with equal time of telephone consultation. If you are financing any portion of the purchase price, as is common in a lot of deals, you still have an investment in the business, so properly training the acquirer is in your best interest.\r\n\r\n<strong>Will I have to sign a non-compete agreement?</strong>\r\n\r\nTypically, yes. The type of non-compete agreement depends on the type of business you are in.\r\n\r\n<strong>When should I tell my employees about the sale?</strong>\r\n\r\nOur considerable experience has proven that it is best to tell your employees about the sale immediately before or immediately after the sale is complete. Of course, if there is an employee whose expertise will be needed after the sale, you should introduce the buyer to this employee shortly before closing.\r\n\r\n<strong>What is expected from a seller in order for Vinehurst to conduct a valuation and to start marketing a business?</strong>\r\n\r\nThe information disclosure requirements for companies vary depend on the type of business. However, most businesses are expected to provide:\r\n• 3-5 years income tax returns, income statements, and balance sheets.\r\n• Current list of equipment, fixtures, and inventory.\r\n• A copy of real estate leases\r\n• Information about property or real estate owned or used by the business.\r\n• Breakdown of employees with titles, salaries and a short biography for each member of the management team.\r\n• Photographs of facilities, equipment, and location, etc.\r\n• Summary documentation for any patents, intellectual property, etc.\r\n• Marketing materials such as copies of advertisements, articles, Yellow Pages ads, newspaper articles, etc.\r\n• Other documentation specific to your business that you believe may have an impact on value.\r\nElite will provide you with a list of required documents and materials. Elite may also require that you participate in a thorough interview allowing us to learn about your business to effectively represent you and your company.\r\n\r\n<strong>How does Vinehurst get paid?</strong>\r\n\r\nWe are paid for mainly on a success basis and therefore receive a transaction fee at the close of the transaction. Depending on the transaction, we also work with customers on a retainer basis with modest upfront fee and lowered success fee.\r\n\r\n<strong>What can I do to help sell my business?</strong>\r\n\r\nSome examples of things you can do to help Vinehurst after we begin the process of selling your business are:\r\n• Provide us with required information in a timely manner.\r\n• Be as accommodating as possible in setting appointments to meet with buyers.\r\n• Conduct business as usual - Keep normal working hours and continue with business as you normally would\r\n• Make sure your financial records are an accurate reflection of revenues, expenses and assets/liability levels.\r\n• Do not let inventory levels dip below normal or delay asset purchases beyond what is reasonable.\r\n• Keep all aspects of the business clean and in good repair.\r\n• Remove equipment or furniture that is not part of the sale.\r\n\r\n<strong>I want to buy a business. How do I proceed?</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFirst, contact us to introduce yourself. Vinehurst will work with you to understand your needs and explore the possibilities. We then provide you the necessary forms such as an Engagement Agreement, Statement of Business Experience, andStatement of Financial Background for you to complete. Once we identify opportunities that fit your needs we will contact you to explore the opportunities and zero in on the opportunity that best fits your needs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Why must I sign confidentiality agreement and provide </strong><strong>resume</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>financial statement</strong>?\r\n\r\nWe are dedicated to servicing the confidentiality needs of our clients. Signing the confidentiality agreement is a painless process in which you promise not to disclose any information that we give you about a business, including the business name, owner information, employee names, etc. Breaches or leaks of confidential information can cause customers to move on, employees to quit, and vendors and lenders to get nervous. This can be detrimental to both the seller and potential acquirer.\r\n\r\nIt is important for acquirers to understand the role of the M&amp;A Advisor and the nature of the merger and acquisition business. Unlike real estate transactions where the “for sale” sign is posted on the property, the business intermediary must act to preserve confidentiality. Breach of confidentiality may cause serious damage to the client. Transaction size and strategic objectives often set the bar for the determining which types of acquirers the seller is willing to consider. To ensure confidentiality and meet strategic goals, a business must be shown only to “qualified” potential acquirers. Non disclosure, Experience, and Financial statements are all important factors in determining the proper fit for a given transaction.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Note:</strong> We provide you with a free preliminary valuation of your company at the beginning of the process. Our years of experience, valuation methods, and review of comparable sales of privately held companies will provide you with a valuation range indicating what your company could sell for in today\'s market. However, keep in mind that initial valuation is only an estimate and the final value of your transaction will depend on the marketing methods, negotiating skills, business environment, deal structure and numerous other factors.','FAQS','','inherit','closed','closed','','902-revision-v1','','','2016-06-17 18:22:08','2016-06-17 18:22:08','','902','http://dev.vinehurst.com/2016/06/17/902-revision-v1/','0','revision','','0'), ('907','1','2016-06-17 18:26:44','2016-06-17 18:26:44','If you’re seriously evaluating your exit strategy, managing the process through a professional may help. Having a third party involved to represent your firm often lends credence by serving as an indication that you\'re serious about selling.\r\nDepending on your size, you may choose a business brokerage or an investment bank. Both help you accurately gauge market interest, bring potential buyers to the table and create a bidding process to get you the best offer. In addition, such an intermediary will be able to guide you through the process – from signing a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) with a prospective buyer to help in structuring a transaction.\r\n\r\nOr, you can sell the business yourself. Whether or not you use an intermediary, arm yourself with a business valuation and good advisors. Here are 10 ways to better prepare for the sale.\r\n1.\r\nGet Your Books in Order: Financial statements are the best indicator of the future performance of a business. Buyers evaluating your company will generally require at least three years\' worth of financial information. The more formal your statements (accountant-reviewed or -prepared vs. internally generated), the better the impression you\'ll make and the easier the due diligence for a buyer. Audited financial statements are ideal. Having a top notch business plan to accompany your financials will increase your credibility with potential buyers.\r\n2.\r\nGrow Your Business to Sell It: It is always easier to sell a business whose sales are growing than one in a downward trend or even flat. Buyers generally want to invest in a company that will provide them with a good return, so they’re willing to pay more for a business that has a positive trend and outlook. If the company\'s future success appears to be threatened (a competitor entering the market, technological advances outdating company products, etc.), the value of the business will be affected. The marketability of the firm may decline as well.\r\n3.\r\nEvaluate the Impact of External Factors: The climate in which a business operates can also affect its valuation and marketability. An overall economic downturn can result in the tightening of corporate belts and a reduction in acquisition activity. In the same manner, a decline within a specific industry or geographic region can also prompt a diminished appetite for private-company acquisitions in those areas. Additionally, a decrease in a public company’s price/earnings ratios tends to produce a corresponding \"trickle down\" effect for the multiples paid for private companies.\r\n4.\r\nValuing Your Business – Using Multiples: There is an abundance of available data on common industry \"multiples\" that can be used to estimate a business\'s value. Over time, valuation experts and investment bankers have observed trends in the selling price of businesses. Multiples are simply a summary version of these trends. They are industry-specific and generally used for smaller businesses. However, while multiples may be useful in providing an immediate ballpark of a business\'s value, they do not substitute for a comprehensive valuation analysis.\r\n5.\r\nValuing Your Business – Taking Intangible Assets Into Account: When pricing your business for sale, intangible assets – such as people, knowledge and market position – can be even more important than tangible property. Customer awareness that underpins a prominent position within the market is a key ingredient in many companies’ success. A strong brand and a loyal customer base can be distinct assets. Other distinct intangible assets include copyrights or trademarks that let a business sell its products for a higher price or in greater quantity than its competition; proprietary mailing lists of customers or prospects; long-term contracts; and franchises with long track records and well-recognized names.\r\n6.\r\nGet a Business Valuation:: A professional valuation will give you a basis for gauging offers. It will give you an idea of what you can expect to net from the sale. It will also tell you your company\'s market position, financial situation, strengths and weaknesses (which you can address prior to putting it on the market). Valuations can be obtained from a number of sources, ranging from local accounting firms to business brokers and investment banking firms. As a rule, you should make sure the company performing your valuation has access to the most current national data regarding privately held transactions in your industry. Experience in selling firms of your type is obviously helpful as well.\r\n7.\r\nMaximize Your Price:Concentrate on Core Competency: A company with a strong focus around a core business generally tends to be more appealing to a buyer than a company going many different directions. Make sure that the focus of all members of the management team is aligned in this direction and that your firm’s products and services add to the value of your core business.\r\n\r\nReduce Customer Concentration: Many small businesses can\'t help but have a handful of customers who generate a large percentage of the company\'s revenues. In general, a buyer will carefully review any client relationship that comprises more than 10% of revenues. Any efforts to reduce the level of customer concentration prior to a sale will be helpful in increasing the reliability of the firm\'s future revenue stream and will help to augment the firm\'s value.\r\n\r\nIndustry Concentration: Specialization can give a company a competitive advantage in winning contracts through industry expertise; it can also force companies to take on risk due to lack of diversity. If an industry suffers a cyclical downturn, a company that has the preponderance of its customer base within that industry may be affected as well. There are exceptions, but industry concentration is usually viewed as undesirable.\r\n8.\r\nKnow Your Buyer: Financial buyers make up an enormous segment of the market. They look for businesses they can buy using debt financing for 50% to 75% of the price. They’re also looking for sufficient cash flow to service that debt. With few exceptions, they value a business by using a multiple of four to six times earnings before interest and taxes (after making adjustments for expenses that would not continue for a new owner). They deduct from the price any interest-bearing debt they will assume. There are disadvantages to selling to a financial buyer: There are no synergies such as access to a larger sales force, or complementary activities in production, engineering, or any other part of the business. Furthermore, there are pressures to increase the cash flow because of the added debt. Financial buyers are in business to make deals, so they often leave day-to-day operations unchanged. But they buy with a view to selling, which could disrupt your business life a second time.\r\n\r\nStrategic buyers expect synergies with their other holdings. They can afford to pay a premium, but they may not need to because they know the market. Buyers offering premium prices are in short supply. The best match sometimes comes about when they seek you out after having determined that your business fits their plans. Strategic buyers may diminish your role, however, and their goals may differ from yours.\r\n9.\r\nPlan for Management Succession: If you\'re absolutely vital to your business, who will a buyer be able to turn to for help running things after you leave? Efforts should be made to gradually delegate key responsibilities (primarily those related to customer relationships and other direct ties to revenue generation) to various members of the senior management team. A buyer\'s primary concern is that the business can operate successfully in the absence of the current executive.\r\n10.\r\nGet Your Ducks in Row: Get an advisory team in place that includes an attorney and accountant who are proficient in mergers and acquisitions. Organize your legal paperwork. Many privately held companies conduct business on an informal, or \"handshake,\" basis with customers and vendors. Informal agreements, however, can result in a discount to value – particularly when they are key to the company\'s success. Formal agreements can ensure the continuity of key relationships, giving a buyer peace of mind that the company\'s customer and supplier relationships (and therefore cash flow) are secure.\r\n\r\nIn addition, review your incorporation papers, permits, licensing agreements and leases. Make sure you have them readily available, current and in order. Make a good first impression. Insure that when prospective buyers visit, they see an orderly operation instead of one that is chaotic. And no matter what, keep your eye on the ball. Don\'t let your business performance decline because you\'re too focused on the sale. This will only give buyers additional negotiating power to lower their offers.','First Post','','inherit','closed','closed','','903-revision-v1','','','2016-06-17 18:26:44','2016-06-17 18:26:44','','903','http://dev.vinehurst.com/2016/06/17/903-revision-v1/','0','revision','','0'), ('908','1','2016-06-17 18:31:05','2016-06-17 18:31:05',' ','','','publish','closed','closed','','908','','','2016-06-19 23:31:41','2016-06-19 23:31:41','','0','http://dev.vinehurst.com/?p=908','6','nav_menu_item','','0'), ('909','1','2016-06-17 18:31:05','2016-06-17 18:31:05',' ','','','publish','closed','closed','','909','','','2016-06-19 23:31:41','2016-06-19 23:31:41','','0','http://dev.vinehurst.com/?p=909','3','nav_menu_item','','0'), ('911','1','2016-06-17 18:31:05','2016-06-17 18:31:05',' ','','','publish','closed','closed','','911','','','2016-06-19 23:31:41','2016-06-19 23:31:41','','0','http://dev.vinehurst.com/?p=911','4','nav_menu_item','','0'), ('913','1','2016-06-17 18:36:29','2016-06-17 18:36:29','<h3>What we do</h3>\r\nVinehurst is an ultra exclusive brokerage boutique. 9 out of every 10 who apply to have Vinehurst represent their business sale are declined, based on our strict qualifying criteria.  We only represent clients who have operated a successful business and/or possess an amazing strategic acquisition.

Having a third party involved to represent your firm often lends credence by serving as an indication that you\'re serious about selling.\r\nDepending on your size, you may choose a business brokerage or an investment bank. Both help you accurately gauge market interest, bring potential buyers to the table and create a bidding process to get you the best offer. In addition, such an intermediary will be able to guide you through the process – from signing a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) with a prospective buyer to help in structuring a transaction.\r\n\r\nOr, you can sell the business yourself. Whether or not you use an intermediary, arm yourself with a business valuation and good advisors. Here are 10 ways to better prepare for the sale.\r\n1.\r\nGet Your Books in Order: Financial statements are the best indicator of the future performance of a business. Buyers evaluating your company will generally require at least three years\' worth of financial information. The more formal your statements (accountant-reviewed or -prepared vs. internally generated), the better the impression you\'ll make and the easier the due diligence for a buyer. Audited financial statements are ideal. Having a top notch business plan to accompany your financials will increase your credibility with potential buyers.\r\n2.\r\nGrow Your Business to Sell It: It is always easier to sell a business whose sales are growing than one in a downward trend or even flat. Buyers generally want to invest in a company that will provide them with a good return, so they’re willing to pay more for a business that has a positive trend and outlook. If the company\'s future success appears to be threatened (a competitor entering the market, technological advances outdating company products, etc.), the value of the business will be affected. The marketability of the firm may decline as well.\r\n3.\r\nEvaluate the Impact of External Factors: The climate in which a business operates can also affect its valuation and marketability. An overall economic downturn can result in the tightening of corporate belts and a reduction in acquisition activity. In the same manner, a decline within a specific industry or geographic region can also prompt a diminished appetite for private-company acquisitions in those areas. Additionally, a decrease in a public company’s price/earnings ratios tends to produce a corresponding \"trickle down\" effect for the multiples paid for private companies.\r\n4.\r\nValuing Your Business – Using Multiples: There is an abundance of available data on common industry \"multiples\" that can be used to estimate a business\'s value. Over time, valuation experts and investment bankers have observed trends in the selling price of businesses. Multiples are simply a summary version of these trends. They are industry-specific and generally used for smaller businesses. However, while multiples may be useful in providing an immediate ballpark of a business\'s value, they do not substitute for a comprehensive valuation analysis.\r\n5.\r\nValuing Your Business – Taking Intangible Assets Into Account: When pricing your business for sale, intangible assets – such as people, knowledge and market position – can be even more important than tangible property. Customer awareness that underpins a prominent position within the market is a key ingredient in many companies’ success. A strong brand and a loyal customer base can be distinct assets. Other distinct intangible assets include copyrights or trademarks that let a business sell its products for a higher price or in greater quantity than its competition; proprietary mailing lists of customers or prospects; long-term contracts; and franchises with long track records and well-recognized names.\r\n6.\r\nGet a Business Valuation:: A professional valuation will give you a basis for gauging offers. It will give you an idea of what you can expect to net from the sale. It will also tell you your company\'s market position, financial situation, strengths and weaknesses (which you can address prior to putting it on the market). Valuations can be obtained from a number of sources, ranging from local accounting firms to business brokers and investment banking firms. As a rule, you should make sure the company performing your valuation has access to the most current national data regarding privately held transactions in your industry. Experience in selling firms of your type is obviously helpful as well.\r\n7.\r\nMaximize Your Price:Concentrate on Core Competency: A company with a strong focus around a core business generally tends to be more appealing to a buyer than a company going many different directions. Make sure that the focus of all members of the management team is aligned in this direction and that your firm’s products and services add to the value of your core business.\r\n\r\nReduce Customer Concentration: Many small businesses can\'t help but have a handful of customers who generate a large percentage of the company\'s revenues. In general, a buyer will carefully review any client relationship that comprises more than 10% of revenues. Any efforts to reduce the level of customer concentration prior to a sale will be helpful in increasing the reliability of the firm\'s future revenue stream and will help to augment the firm\'s value.\r\n\r\nIndustry Concentration: Specialization can give a company a competitive advantage in winning contracts through industry expertise; it can also force companies to take on risk due to lack of diversity. If an industry suffers a cyclical downturn, a company that has the preponderance of its customer base within that industry may be affected as well. There are exceptions, but industry concentration is usually viewed as undesirable.\r\n8.\r\nKnow Your Buyer: Financial buyers make up an enormous segment of the market. They look for businesses they can buy using debt financing for 50% to 75% of the price. They’re also looking for sufficient cash flow to service that debt. With few exceptions, they value a business by using a multiple of four to six times earnings before interest and taxes (after making adjustments for expenses that would not continue for a new owner). They deduct from the price any interest-bearing debt they will assume. There are disadvantages to selling to a financial buyer: There are no synergies such as access to a larger sales force, or complementary activities in production, engineering, or any other part of the business. Furthermore, there are pressures to increase the cash flow because of the added debt. Financial buyers are in business to make deals, so they often leave day-to-day operations unchanged. But they buy with a view to selling, which could disrupt your business life a second time.\r\n\r\nStrategic buyers expect synergies with their other holdings. They can afford to pay a premium, but they may not need to because they know the market. Buyers offering premium prices are in short supply. The best match sometimes comes about when they seek you out after having determined that your business fits their plans. Strategic buyers may diminish your role, however, and their goals may differ from yours.\r\n9.\r\nPlan for Management Succession: If you\'re absolutely vital to your business, who will a buyer be able to turn to for help running things after you leave? Efforts should be made to gradually delegate key responsibilities (primarily those related to customer relationships and other direct ties to revenue generation) to various members of the senior management team. A buyer\'s primary concern is that the business can operate successfully in the absence of the current executive.\r\n10.\r\nGet Your Ducks in Row: Get an advisory team in place that includes an attorney and accountant who are proficient in mergers and acquisitions. Organize your legal paperwork. Many privately held companies conduct business on an informal, or \"handshake,\" basis with customers and vendors. Informal agreements, however, can result in a discount to value – particularly when they are key to the company\'s success. Formal agreements can ensure the continuity of key relationships, giving a buyer peace of mind that the company\'s customer and supplier relationships (and therefore cash flow) are secure.\r\n\r\nIn addition, review your incorporation papers, permits, licensing agreements and leases. Make sure you have them readily available, current and in order. Make a good first impression. Insure that when prospective buyers visit, they see an orderly operation instead of one that is chaotic. And no matter what, keep your eye on the ball. Don\'t let your business performance decline because you\'re too focused on the sale. This will only give buyers additional negotiating power to lower their offers.','10 Tips on Selling Your Business','','inherit','closed','closed','','903-revision-v1','','','2016-06-19 21:01:18','2016-06-19 21:01:18','','903','http://dev.vinehurst.com/2016/06/19/903-revision-v1/','0','revision','','0'), ('942','1','2016-06-20 02:07:17','2016-06-20 02:07:17',' ','','','publish','closed','closed','','942','','','2016-06-20 02:07:17','2016-06-20 02:07:17','','0','http://dev.vinehurst.com/?p=942','1','nav_menu_item','','0'), ('941','1','2016-06-20 00:00:15','2016-06-20 00:00:15','','stock-photo-hispanic-business-owner-using-laptop-in-store-100105379','','inherit','open','closed','','stock-photo-hispanic-business-owner-using-laptop-in-store-100105379','','','2016-06-20 00:00:15','2016-06-20 00:00:15','','0','http://dev.vinehurst.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/stock-photo-hispanic-business-owner-using-laptop-in-store-100105379.png','0','attachment','image/png','0'), ('933','1','2016-06-19 21:44:24','2016-06-19 21:44:24','','About Us','','publish','closed','closed','','about-us','','','2016-06-19 23:31:41','2016-06-19 23:31:41','','0','http://dev.vinehurst.com/?p=933','2','nav_menu_item','','0'), ('934','1','2016-06-19 23:09:16','2016-06-19 23:09:16','At Vinehurst we understand that each of our clients is unique and has different objectives that need to be considered prior to recommending a specific strategy for buying and selling a business. While many M&amp;A firms recommend a \"broad stroke\" process to selling a business, many private business owners seek to strike a balance between a premium price for their business and a process which is more discreet and limits disruption to the business.  In this competitive business environment, maintaining confidentiality and controlling the flow of company information is of paramount importance.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor corporate divestitures, objectives in a transaction can vary from those of private business owners.

Having a third party involved to represent your firm often lends credence by serving as an indication that you\'re serious about selling.\r\nDepending on your size, you may choose a business brokerage or an investment bank. Both help you accurately gauge market interest, bring potential buyers to the table and create a bidding process to get you the best offer. In addition, such an intermediary will be able to guide you through the process – from signing a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) with a prospective buyer to help in structuring a transaction.\r\n\r\nOr, you can sell the business yourself. Whether or not you use an intermediary, arm yourself with a business valuation and good advisors. Here are 10 ways to better prepare for the sale.\r\n<h4>1. Get Your Books in Order:</h4>\r\nFinancial statements are the best indicator of the future performance of a business. Buyers evaluating your company will generally require at least three years\' worth of financial information. The more formal your statements (accountant-reviewed or -prepared vs. internally generated), the better the impression you\'ll make and the easier the due diligence for a buyer. Audited financial statements are ideal. Having a top notch business plan to accompany your financials will increase your credibility with potential buyers.\r\n<h4>2. Grow Your Business to Sell It:</h4>\r\nIt is always easier to sell a business whose sales are growing than one in a downward trend or even flat. Buyers generally want to invest in a company that will provide them with a good return, so they’re willing to pay more for a business that has a positive trend and outlook. If the company\'s future success appears to be threatened (a competitor entering the market, technological advances outdating company products, etc.), the value of the business will be affected. The marketability of the firm may decline as well.\r\n<h4>3. Evaluate the Impact of External Factors:</h4>\r\nThe climate in which a business operates can also affect its valuation and marketability. An overall economic downturn can result in the tightening of corporate belts and a reduction in acquisition activity. In the same manner, a decline within a specific industry or geographic region can also prompt a diminished appetite for private-company acquisitions in those areas. Additionally, a decrease in a public company’s price/earnings ratios tends to produce a corresponding \"trickle down\" effect for the multiples paid for private companies.\r\n<h4>4. Valuing Your Business – Using Multiples:</h4>\r\nThere is an abundance of available data on common industry \"multiples\" that can be used to estimate a business\'s value. Over time, valuation experts and investment bankers have observed trends in the selling price of businesses. Multiples are simply a summary version of these trends. They are industry-specific and generally used for smaller businesses. However, while multiples may be useful in providing an immediate ballpark of a business\'s value, they do not substitute for a comprehensive valuation analysis.\r\n<h4>5. Valuing Your Business – Taking Intangible Assets Into Account:</h4>\r\nWhen pricing your business for sale, intangible assets – such as people, knowledge and market position – can be even more important than tangible property. Customer awareness that underpins a prominent position within the market is a key ingredient in many companies’ success. A strong brand and a loyal customer base can be distinct assets. Other distinct intangible assets include copyrights or trademarks that let a business sell its products for a higher price or in greater quantity than its competition; proprietary mailing lists of customers or prospects; long-term contracts; and franchises with long track records and well-recognized names.\r\n<h4>6. Get a Business Valuation:</h4>\r\nA professional valuation will give you a basis for gauging offers. It will give you an idea of what you can expect to net from the sale. It will also tell you your company\'s market position, financial situation, strengths and weaknesses (which you can address prior to putting it on the market). Valuations can be obtained from a number of sources, ranging from local accounting firms to business brokers and investment banking firms. As a rule, you should make sure the company performing your valuation has access to the most current national data regarding privately held transactions in your industry. Experience in selling firms of your type is obviously helpful as well.\r\n<h4>7. Maximize Your Price:Concentrate on Core Competency:</h4>\r\nA company with a strong focus around a core business generally tends to be more appealing to a buyer than a company going many different directions. Make sure that the focus of all members of the management team is aligned in this direction and that your firm’s products and services add to the value of your core business.\r\n\r\nReduce Customer Concentration:\r\n\r\nMany small businesses can\'t help but have a handful of customers who generate a large percentage of the company\'s revenues. In general, a buyer will carefully review any client relationship that comprises more than 10% of revenues. Any efforts to reduce the level of customer concentration prior to a sale will be helpful in increasing the reliability of the firm\'s future revenue stream and will help to augment the firm\'s value.\r\n\r\nIndustry Concentration:\r\n\r\nSpecialization can give a company a competitive advantage in winning contracts through industry expertise; it can also force companies to take on risk due to lack of diversity. If an industry suffers a cyclical downturn, a company that has the preponderance of its customer base within that industry may be affected as well. There are exceptions, but industry concentration is usually viewed as undesirable.\r\n<h4>8. Know Your Buyer:</h4>\r\nFinancial buyers make up an enormous segment of the market. They look for businesses they can buy using debt financing for 50% to 75% of the price. They’re also looking for sufficient cash flow to service that debt. With few exceptions, they value a business by using a multiple of four to six times earnings before interest and taxes (after making adjustments for expenses that would not continue for a new owner). They deduct from the price any interest-bearing debt they will assume. There are disadvantages to selling to a financial buyer: There are no synergies such as access to a larger sales force, or complementary activities in production, engineering, or any other part of the business. Furthermore, there are pressures to increase the cash flow because of the added debt. Financial buyers are in business to make deals, so they often leave day-to-day operations unchanged. But they buy with a view to selling, which could disrupt your business life a second time.\r\n\r\nStrategic buyers expect synergies with their other holdings. They can afford to pay a premium, but they may not need to because they know the market. Buyers offering premium prices are in short supply. The best match sometimes comes about when they seek you out after having determined that your business fits their plans. Strategic buyers may diminish your role, however, and their goals may differ from yours.\r\n<h4>9. Plan for Management Succession:</h4>\r\nIf you\'re absolutely vital to your business, who will a buyer be able to turn to for help running things after you leave? Efforts should be made to gradually delegate key responsibilities (primarily those related to customer relationships and other direct ties to revenue generation) to various members of the senior management team. A buyer\'s primary concern is that the business can operate successfully in the absence of the current executive.\r\n<h4>10. Get Your Ducks in Row:</h4>\r\nGet an advisory team in place that includes an attorney and accountant who are proficient in mergers and acquisitions. Organize your legal paperwork. Many privately held companies conduct business on an informal, or \"handshake,\" basis with customers and vendors.

While many M&amp;A firms recommend a \"broad stroke\" process to selling a business, many private business owners seek to strike a balance between a premium price for their business and a process which is more discreet and limits disruption to the business.  In this competitive business environment, maintaining confidentiality and controlling the flow of company information is of paramount importance.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor corporate divestitures, objectives in a transaction can vary from those of private business owners. Speed and certainty of close are often high priority elements of a corporate divestiture process.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhether it is a private sale or a corporate divestiture, a customized sale process with appropriate advance screening of potential buyers can meet varying client objectives.  We commit to understand the individual goals of each of our client’s and then recommend a transaction and a strategy that best satisfies those goals.\r\n<h3>Corporate Development Services</h3>\r\nWhile many companies are interested in expanding through acquisition, partnering or joint venture arrangements, they are often reluctant to invest in a dedicated corporate development group at the company or the current group is busy with other responsibilities. At Vinehurst, we can provide corporate development services on an outsourced basis or we can provide assistance to an existing group on a project basis. Where appropriate, we can also assist a company in establishing an internal corporate development group. We have worked with in-house corporate development groups at a variety of companies and we have developed a best practices approach to the corporate development function.\r\n<h3>Other Advisory Services</h3>\r\nWe understand that companies often require assistance with unique situations that go beyond a straight forward sale or acquisition of a business. These situations often require some level of advisory support, but may not require the full menu of services provided by an M&amp;A advisor. We can be flexible in terms of our engagements, including fee structures, based on the specific needs of the client. We have the interest, flexibility and experience to advise companies on any of the following situations:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Representing a seller or buyer in an exclusive negotiation with a single counter party;</li>\r\n 	<li>Assisting a CFO in raising or refinancing a senior debt facility;</li>\r\n 	<li>Raising subordinated debt or equity for acquisitions, liquidity or growth;</li>\r\n 	<li>Assisting a management team in a buyout from a corporate parent or private owner;</li>\r\n 	<li>Assisting an individual or corporate shareholder in buying out other shareholder(s); or</li>\r\n 	<li>Other services such as strategic alternatives analysis and M&amp;A related valuations.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFind out today if you qualify for our representation.','Services','','inherit','closed','closed','','901-revision-v1','','','2016-06-19 23:12:56','2016-06-19 23:12:56','','901','http://dev.vinehurst.com/2016/06/19/901-revision-v1/','0','revision','','0'), ('939','1','2016-06-19 23:53:15','2016-06-19 23:53:15','','stock-photo-daily-office-lifestyle-146267651','','inherit','open','closed','','stock-photo-daily-office-lifestyle-146267651','','','2016-06-19 23:53:15','2016-06-19 23:53:15','','0','http://dev.vinehurst.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/stock-photo-daily-office-lifestyle-146267651.png','0','attachment','image/png','0'), ('943','1','2016-06-20 02:07:17','2016-06-20 02:07:17',' ','','','publish','closed','closed','','943','','','2016-06-20 02:07:17','2016-06-20 02:07:17','','0','http://dev.vinehurst.com/?p=943','5','nav_menu_item','','0'), ('944','1','2016-06-20 02:07:17','2016-06-20 02:07:17',' ','','','publish','closed','closed','','944','','','2016-06-20 02:07:17','2016-06-20 02:07:17','','0','http://dev.vinehurst.com/?p=944','3','nav_menu_item','','0'), ('945','1','2016-06-20 02:07:17','2016-06-20 02:07:17',' ','','','publish','closed','closed','','945','','','2016-06-20 02:07:17','2016-06-20 02:07:17','','0','http://dev.vinehurst.com/?p=945','4','nav_menu_item','','0'), ('946','1','2016-06-20 02:07:17','2016-06-20 02:07:17','','NDA','','publish','closed','closed','','nda','','','2016-06-20 02:07:17','2016-06-20 02:07:17','','0','http://dev.vinehurst.com/?p=946','2','nav_menu_item','','0');
